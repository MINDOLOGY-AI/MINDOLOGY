"""
Config for Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B (text branch only).

This is the concrete 4B checkpoint text config, pulled from the cached HF
weights' config.json. Keep model-specific hyperparameters here so the generic
modules in synapse/algorithms stay reusable.

Architecture: 8 blocks of [3 linear-attention (Gated DeltaNet) layers
+ 1 full-attention layer]. The vision tower is not implemented.
